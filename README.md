# *Replace with YourProposedProposedProjectName*
## Description/Motivation

I have had intrest in both businses and computer scince. My project idea is to create a retail store website which cutomers can use to selct and buy items either online or while inperson at the store. all the items will be stored ina database and there prices too aftere selcting waht they want to purchase. we calcuate what it will cost for them to but the Items.

Project name:   Crafts Gallery 
Project proposal (including purpose): I am creating a ebsite for a retail; store that deal; in sealling crafts to the community. The software should be able to support both online and instore purchase made by customers
[Scope]: These retail store should provide friendly experince for the customers in their purchassing process. It should be able to in form them how many items of what they need are left in the store and how much each cost. It also should show them what are the items on sale, and the discuonts basssed on memebership in the store.  for my out of scope Idea I am considering to crerate a site that hides Items that are out of stock, my reason is that some customers are not happy to llok through a site then endup finding out that the item they are looking for is not instock right before they purchase it. Also use the approximated time to stock items that run out of time to inform cutomesr that this items will be back in stock on a certain day.
[Vision]: My vision is to provide the best experteince for the customers as they interct with the store website to acquire items that fulfill their needs.
